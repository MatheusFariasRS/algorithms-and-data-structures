# Data Structures and Algorithms in Java

This repository contains my studies on data structures and algorithms, implemented in Java, focusing on core computer science concepts.

Topics include strings, arrays, recursion, algorithm complexity, searching and sorting, lists, stacks and queues, sets and maps, trees, greedy algorithms, graphs, and dynamic programming.
